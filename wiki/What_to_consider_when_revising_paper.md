This monograph focuses on writing paper on theoretical topic. For paper
which focuses on algorithms, system or applications. Some details may
differ but the general rules apply.

Model article
-------------

You should follow the writing style of this
[https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09105
article](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.09105_article "wikilink")

Literature Review
-----------------

Do not use too negative statements when criticize on previous works.

Grammar
-------

-   For title of a paper, please uppercase each noun, adjective. No need
    to uppercase preposition word.
-   Word typo means misspelling. You can enable spell check in your
    editor to avoid this stupid problem.
-   For other grammar problems, you should check by yourself carefully
    with some external tools. For example,

` `[`https://languagetool.org/`` ``Languagetool`](https://languagetool.org/_Languagetool "wikilink")` or `[`https://grammarly.com`` ``Grammarly`](https://grammarly.com_Grammarly "wikilink")

### English punctuation

For the question whether you should write punctuation in math formula.
The reason to add punctuation is to treat the formula as a part of a
sentence. However, there is no universal convention. For inline maths,
they are an integral part of a sentence. Therefore, do not forget to add
proper punctuations after inline maths.

Make sure your style is uniform.

Logic
-----

Make sure the sentence in your paper connect well with the preceding and
the next sentence in the article. And every sentence in your paper
should have some purpose (Do not pad out words).

Have you defined your problem
-----------------------------

Which word you should use
-------------------------

### follow

This is particularly important which verb you should choose. For
example, when you express "some random variables follow some kinds of
distributions". The word "follow" is commonly used instead of "conform",
which is translated directly from Chinese equivalent "服从".

### Figure

When referring to some figures in the article, please make sure the word
you use matches the word in the template. This means that if the figure
caption shows "Fig. 2. ....", you should use the abbreviated word "Fig."
in your main text. If the caption shows "Figure 3. ...", you should use
the whole word instead. The former case is more common.

Proper nouns
------------

Do not invent English proper nouns from Chinese equivalent. You should
make sure the proper noun you used in your paper is commonly accepted in
English language community. Check [https://en.wikipedia.org/
wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/_wikipedia "wikilink") is a good
choice. For example, when you express Chinese "二阶矩阵", google
translator will tell you it's "second order matrix", which is a not good
choice. Actually, you should use "2 by 2 matrix".

Is your topic important
-----------------------

For reviewers, they are busy. You should state clearly why your topic is
important instead of introducing too much fact about your topic.

Math Notations
--------------

Use commonly accepted notations instead of inventing strange ones. For
example, *I*(*X*; *Y*) is commonly used in Information Theory Community
to represent mutual information. Therefore, you should avoid define your
own *I*(*x*, *y*) for other purposes.

### Things you should avoid

For example, the Latin alphabet *a* is similar with Greek alphabet *α*.
It is easy for readers to treat the two letters as the same letter. Try
to avoid to use them together in one formula.

Work efficiency
---------------

You should improve your work efficiency gradually. For example, if
generally revising a paper takes half a day to 2 days. You should not
finish this task more than 3 days. Proper stay-up is acceptable if some
urgent tasks are to be done and your work efficiency is not quick
enough.

Abstract v.s Conclusion
-----------------------

Abstract and Conclusion are similar, both of which summarize the main
work of the paper. But there are two differences to be noted.

-   Background summary is common in Abstract but rare in Conclusion.
-   Technical terminology should be referred in its full name in
    Abstract and can be abbreviated in Conclusion
-   Future work is allowed in Conclusion but seldom appears in Abstract.
